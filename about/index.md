Hey!
My name is Filipe Monteiro, also known as **Pi** (yes, **THAT** π). I was born in 1998, February the 28th, at Guimarães, Portugal. Right now I am studying "Software Engineering" at Minho University in Braga, Portugal, and I am currently on my second year (out of five, still  a loooooong way).

I've gained my passion for programming and computer science when I was around 14 years old, when I learned a basic language, Pascal, until it became to complex for me to continue (learning it without any help was hard). So, after ending High School I immediatly knew what I wanted to do in the future: PROGRAMMING.

By the way, check some of my [projects](https://github.com/pimonteiro?tab=repositories)!!




Right now my tastes rest on Security and Networking-Security, as well as, software engineering. Gotta love both sides, uhn?

Oh, and I also used to play the piano for 8 years, give or take (I still wish I could continue to play it, but as time goes by and programming takes too much of it...), all by myself. If for some reason you want to check some of my previous adventures on music, be sure to see a [**few of my videos**](https://www.youtube.com/user/Pimonteiro1/videos/).
